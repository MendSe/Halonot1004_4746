Game Monitoring Dashboard in C#
A game monitoring application developed in C# using MVVM architecture and a 3-layer structure (Data Access Layer, Business Logic, and Presentation Layer with WPF). This application integrates multiple APIs, including the Twitch and IGDB APIs, to retrieve real-time game data, player statistics, and server states. A Python-based Flask server is used to handle Twitch data via custom scripts. Key features include:

Real-time game statistics, including player count and server status.
Game search functionality with detailed information retrieved from the IGDB API.
CPU and RAM usage estimation based on player activity.
Modular and reusable architecture for scalability and maintainability.
